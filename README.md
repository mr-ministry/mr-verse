## Features

- Display Bible verses on a secondary monitor or projector
- Support for multiple Bible translations
- Easy navigation between verses

- Switch between translations for the same verse
- Optimized for low-resource usage

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24 or later
- GCC or another C compiler (required for Fyne)

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mr-ministry/mr-verse.git
   cd mr-verse
   ```

2. Build the application:

   ```bash
   go build -o mr-verse ./cmd/main.go
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   ./mr-verse
   ```

## Usage

### Controller Window

The controller window allows you to:

- Search for Bible verses using the format "Book Chapter:Verse" (e.g., "John 3:16")
- Navigate to the previous or next verse
- Select a Bible translation
- Open or close the live presentation window
- Update the live window with the current verse

### Live Window

The live window displays the selected Bible verse and is designed to be shown on a secondary monitor or projector.

### Multi-Monitor Support

To configure the live window to appear on a secondary monitor, set the `SECONDARY_MONITOR_BOUNDS` environment variable in the format "x,y,width,height".

Example:

```bash
export SECONDARY_MONITOR_BOUNDS="1920,0,1280,720"
```

This will position the live window at coordinates (1920,0) with a size of 1280x720 pixels.

## Bible Translations

The application comes with several Bible translations in JSON format:

- NIV (New International Version)
- NKJV (New King James Version)
- NLT (New Living Translation)
- RCPV (Revised Common Prayer Version)

Additional translations can be added by placing JSON files in the `data` directory.
